# MyComponent

MyComponent is a React functional component that demonstrates how to use the useState and useEffect hooks to handle state and side effects, respectively. It fetches data from an API based on the count state and displays the fetched data in a list.

# How to Use

Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:
bash
Copy code
npm install react
Import and render MyComponent in your React application:
jsx
Copy code
import React from 'react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent'; // Adjust the path if needed

function App() {
return (

<div className="App">
<h1>My React App</h1>
<MyComponent />
</div>
);
}

export default App;
Start your React application:
bash
Copy code
npm start

# Props

The MyComponent does not accept any props.

# State

count (number): Represents the current count value. It can be incremented or decremented by clicking the corresponding buttons.

data (array): Stores the data fetched from the API based on the count state.

loading (boolean): Indicates whether the API request is in progress. When true, a "Loading..." message is displayed; otherwise, the fetched data is shown in a list.

# UseEffect Hook

The component uses the useEffect hook to handle side effects. When the count state changes, the effect is triggered, and an API call is made using the fetchData function. The AbortController is used to enable cancellation of the ongoing API request if the component unmounts before the request completes.

# How to Customize

Replace the API endpoint in the fetch call inside the fetchData function with your desired API endpoint.

Modify the rendering and logic in the component's return block to fit your application's requirements.
